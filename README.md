### Profile

An ambitious and adaptable developer, with a previous career in medical communications and a strong belief in ownership and the inherent value of curiosity. 

### My journey

After 4 years working in pharmaceutical client services, I had an urge to combine my love of STEM with a more directly creative role.

Often the resident tech evangelist at work, I would always suggest simple tech-related improvements: re-working a spreadsheet, improving a process through the use of Google Docs.

As a developer I'm now hooked on the thrill of building things and learning about new technologies, and I can't wait to take this enthusiasm into my next team.

## Skills


### Clean code

- Good design: during our [Grandmasters](https://github.com/mikjw/makers-final-project) final project at Makers, I constantly considered the design of our modules in relation to a) substituting a 'computer' opponent for a real player and b) easily switching in new rules. The rules could have become coupled to the game, but with careful design we able to extract and easily change them.

- TDD: used from the beginning at Makers, TDD has brought about a couple of serious 'AHA' moments! I've learned the great utility of applying test-first strictly, as in my [Bank Tech Test](https://github.com/mikjw/bank-tech-test), and reflected on cases where it's less appropriate.


### Teamwork, quality, speed, clarity

- I've managed teams for a several years and I'm very interested in factors for team success. I really care about the importance of different learning styles, considered first as a language tutor at university, later applied in managing colleages at BBH.

- I have a thirst for working at pace. Strengthened by working under pressure in agencies, but tempered by natural interest in detail. This served me well as final sign-off on work for clients.

- I love clear explanation of technical subjects. A staple throughout my previous career was breaking down medical information to brief creative teams without a scientific background, and hopefully inspiring them to create strong work.


### No comfort zone

My life seems to have followed a pattern of seeking out challenge:

- While at university I joined the Officer Training Corps of the Army and took on the demanding training alongside legal study.

- I moved to Toulouse to study in a foriegn language and constantly pushed myself to integrate and become 'fluent'.

- I followed my interest in medicine into a career in pharmaceutical marketing, where I had to quickly master large volumes of scientific information and discuss it with authority with clients. As Account Manager at BBH I actively sought out opportunities to work on pitches with new subjects to learn and potential to grow the business. 

- Now as a developer I relish opening a new codebase and trying to quickly understand it (especially if it's written in a language that's new to me).
